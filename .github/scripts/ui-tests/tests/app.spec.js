// plumbing as TEST_AUTH_CREDENTIAL (workflow secret -> ui-suite input -> env).
// ⚠️ NOT ACTUALLY A SECRET: this value is typed into a VISIBLE input, so
// failure screenshots and first-retry traces record it in the rendered DOM,
// where GitHub's log masking cannot reach. Use a throwaway test-account
// address that identifies nobody — never a real person's email. (The password
// renders as dots; the identifier renders as itself. That asymmetry is why
// this warning exists here and not on TEST_AUTH_CREDENTIAL.)
// AND IT GATES THE IDENTIFIER-FIRST PATH ENTIRELY (#310). A split-step login
// shows an email step BEFORE any password field, so detectAuthGate() must be
// able to call it a gate — but a lone visible email input is ALSO a newsletter
// box, and treating one as a gate would skip S3/NAV/CTRL/DISMISS on a healthy
// public app. Requiring TEST_AUTH_EMAIL is what keeps that blast radius at
// zero for every project that has not opted in: unset, nothing below changes.
// Without it there is also nothing to type — filling the PASSWORD into an
// identifier field is worse than not trying.

// (round 10), and the load-and-authenticate preamble (round 12). The rule was
// written HERE after round 7 and the last two sites still shipped wrong. The
// classification below is therefore exhaustive by construction — every
// networkidle wait in this file appears in exactly one of the two lists.
//
// LOAD_SETTLE_MS — a late arrival turns a FAIL into a PASS (11 sites):
//   S1, ENTRY          a late error is never counted and the gate is green
//   S2 (x2)            pre-auth: detectAuthGate's answer becomes mechanism
//                      'none', so S2 passes without ever trying the credential.
//                      post-auth: verifying mid-flight reads a not-yet-dismissed
//                      gate as retained and fails a login that SUCCEEDED. This
//                      second site was in the file and not in this list —

// BUDGET SIZING — a scenario that CAN SKIP needs a budget sized for the day it
// stops skipping (directives#306)
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Every scenario below sets its own test.setTimeout and derives it at the
// scenario. This is the rule those numbers are derived UNDER, and it inverts the
// intuition:
//
//     A SCENARIO THAT HAS BEEN SKIPPING HAS NO EVIDENCE BEHIND ITS BUDGET.
//     ITS OBSERVED RUNTIME IS ZERO, WHICH PROVES NOTHING.
//
// A skip records ~0ms, every run, which reads exactly like "fast" to anyone
// sizing from history. The moment the precondition is satisfied — a credential
// set, APP_PAGES declared, a fixture seeded — the scenario runs for the first
// time against a number nobody derived.
//
// Measured, claude.insurance 2026-08-25: their S2 carried no budget at all and
// inherited the 30s config default. It had never executed until their owner set
// TEST_AUTH_CREDENTIAL an hour earlier. First run: 11.0 / 12.1 / 11.4 / 11.6s
// across four projects — ~2.5x margin, the THINNEST in their suite, on the one
// scenario that went from never-running to running-every-time that morning.
// Their S3, which had always run, carried an explicit 240_000.
//
// So, three rules:
//   * Size a skippable scenario for its FIRST REAL RUN, not for its history, and
//     say IN ITS BUDGET COMMENT which precondition unlocks it. Every scenario
//     below that can skip names its own.
//   * "It has always been fast" is INADMISSIBLE when the observed runs are
//     skips. That is zero data presented as reassurance — the same shape as a
//     green that verified nothing.
//   * When a precondition is newly satisfied in a repo, re-read that scenario's
//     budget BEFORE the first run, not after it times out. A first real run
//     exercises several never-exercised things at once: the day S2 stops
//     skipping is also the first day expectGateCleared() has a verdict to reach.

//     ----------------------------------------------------------
//     ~53s at N=4        ~94s at N=8
//
// N is the CREDENTIAL LENGTH — supplied per project, so like S3's element count
// it is not bounded by any constant in this file. Every budget below that

//
// And the whole preamble — goto + settle + detectAuthGate + detectAndAuth +
// settle — is the ~98s figure NAV's budget already used. It was derived there in
// round 5 and then not applied to S2, S4 or CTRL, which is how three scenarios
// came to be sized for two of their five terms.
//
// SPLIT-STEP (#310) — a SECOND pass through the same loop, and the only path
// that costs more than the sum above. It requires TEST_AUTH_EMAIL to be set AND
// an identifier-first step to be discovered, so every project on a PIN, a
// password form, an email+password form or no gate at all pays exactly zero:
//
//     identifier step:  waitFor 10 + fill 10 + submit 10 + LOAD_SETTLE_MS 25
//                                                              = 55s

//     ~108s at N=4       ~149s at N=8      (delta: +55s, flat in N)
//
// The credential step's ladder may fill an identifier AGAIN (a step-2 form that
// re-shows the email). That is already inside the 33s password figure, and the

// burning a fill timeout. PIN remains the sizing case at both N.

  // it, because expectGateCleared() returns immediately on 'none' and the S2
  // failure check below is itself guarded by `mechanism !== 'none'`. Every

  // missed, and nothing said so.
  //
  // MEASURED DOWNSTREAM, not theorised (claude.insurance, 2026-08-26). This
  // kit's own default navigation is `./`, which in that app is public marketing
  // with no gate at all, while the login lives on a sub-route. S2 had been
  // vacuous SINCE IT WAS WRITTEN — including a green live run cited as evidence
  // that auth was covered. Grafting #309's verifier on top changed nothing: it
  // was verifying an attempt that was never made. An app with a public surface
  // and an authenticated portal is the normal shape, not an exotic one, so this
  // is a hole in the kit rather than a mistake in one project.

  // supplying TEST_AUTH_CREDENTIAL / TEST_AUTH_EMAIL is the project asserting
  // it has a gate. Config plus no gate here is a contradiction between what the
  // project declared and where this scenario landed — a defect, and loud. No
  // config and no gate is an app without auth — legitimate, but a SKIP so it is

  // the 240_000 this replaces was written when the matrix was phones only, and
  // desktop and tablet arrived later without anyone re-reading the number.
  //
  // This budget is sized from MEASUREMENT, not from a worst case — with the
  // element count unbounded, no fixed number can be a true ceiling. ~14.5s per
  // element in the worst case means ~62 elements fills 900s, while the real
  // apps measured below sweep far more than that far faster. If your app is
  // control-dense enough to approach it, re-measure rather than assume.
  //

  // inside overflow:hidden boxes are skipped, and a wide viewport clips FEWER
  // of them — so more get swept. Measured in claude.trading (run 32655955615,
  // head 607ab63): mobile-chrome and iphone 468s PASS, tablet >480s TIMEOUT.

  // tuned to just-above-observed reports as flakiness rather than as signal,
  // which is how 240 survived: a test TIMEOUT reads as infra noise, so nobody
  // investigates it. Raise this BEFORE adding projects, never after — and see
  // the calling job's timeout-minutes, which this number pushes against.

// wrongly INCLUDED costs a destructive click. So "Roll back", "Move back" and
// "Step back" no longer match, while "Go back", "Navigate back" and the icon
// ligatures do.
// The prefix also closes the ligature gap the suffix rule left open: the left

  // against 1_200_000 with the cap still at 3. NAV_RESET_CAP 3 -> 2 brings it to
  // ~1075s and the ceiling does NOT move — which is the trade this paragraph

  // term surfaced, because the resets buy this scenario nothing (a navigating
  // trigger is not an overlay trigger) and spending fewer of them is the cheap
  // side every time. The cost is real and NOT silent: one less reset means a
  // nav-heavy app reaches fewer triggers, which writes the `dismiss-budget`
  // attachment the paragraph below already tells you to read.
  //
  // ⚠️ IF THIS TIMES OUT ANYWAY, do not revise this sum a sixth time. Read the
