    // ⚠️ BOTH OF THESE DEFAULT TO 0 = NO TIMEOUT IN PLAYWRIGHT TEST, and that is
    // the whole reason they are here. Left unset, an action or a navigation is
    // bounded only by the enclosing test timeout, so ONE hung call consumes a
    // scenario's entire budget — which made every per-scenario sum in
    // tests/app.spec.js a fiction, since each was built from terms that were not
    // themselves bounded.
    //
    // Set the whole surface at once, deliberately: bounding these one at a time
    // as each is discovered leaves the next one unbounded, which is exactly how
    // this shipped twice.
    //
    // Scope of that claim, narrowed after it was over-stated once: these two
    // plus `timeout` above and expect's own default (5s) are the complete
    // PER-TEST and PER-OPERATION surface. They are not the whole of Playwright.
    //
    // `globalTimeout` (run-level, also defaulting to 0) is deliberately NOT set
    // here. The aggregate bound for this suite is the CALLING JOB's
    // timeout-minutes — the ui-suite composite cannot carry per-step timeouts,
    // so the job already owns that role, and check-job-bounds.py enforces its
    // floor. A template-level globalTimeout would have to be sized for the
    // slowest repo in the fleet (the same problem the job floor already solves),
    // and it ABORTS THE RUN rather than failing a test — which is strictly less
    // diagnosable than the per-test timeouts above, and the opposite of what the
    // rest of this change is for. A direct `npx playwright test` outside CI has
    // no such wrapper: bound it with --global-timeout if you need one there.
    //
    // navigationTimeout — a page that cannot load in 30s is a failure worth
    // reporting as one, not worth waiting out. Governs goto(); the matching cap
    // for waitForLoadState('networkidle') is IDLE_MS in tests/app.spec.js, which
    // passes an explicit and much shorter timeout at every call site.
    navigationTimeout: 30_000,
    // actionTimeout — the floor for click()/fill()/press()/selectOption() calls
    // that pass no timeout of their own. Most call sites in app.spec.js DO pass
    // one (2-3s) and those still win; this exists for the ones that cannot
    // reasonably guess, notably detectAndAuth()'s keypad and form interactions.
    // 10s is generous for a control that is going to become actionable at all.

  // THIS LIST IS THE ONLY THING THAT DECIDES WHAT WIDTHS THIS APP IS EVER
  // RENDERED AT. One spec set (tests/app.spec.js) runs against two targets — the
  // bundled local server in qa.yml, the live URL in qa-live.yml/qa-response.yml —
  // and both inherit this list; exactly one test sets a viewport of its own (S4,
  // at 390). There is no second tier to compensate, so trimming this to phone
  // profiles leaves nothing anywhere rendering the app at laptop width, and CI
  // stays green while it happens: a viewport never instantiated produces no
  // failing test. claude.prop's copy of this file lost its laptop and tablet
  // profiles exactly that way, and nothing reported it.
  // check-ui-viewports.js (run by the ui-suite composite) now fails the build on
  // it, by IMPORTING this file rather than reading it as text.
